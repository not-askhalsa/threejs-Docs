      <h2>Three-js-fundamentals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is a <b>Renderer</b>. This is arguably the main object of three.js. You pass a Scene and a Camera to a
          Renderer and it renders (draws) the portion of the 3D scene that is inside the frustum of the camera as a 2D
          image to a canvas.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          There is a <b>scenegraph</b> which is a tree like structure, consisting of various objects like a Scene
          object, multiple Mesh objects, Light objects, Group, Object3D, and Camera objects. A Scene object defines the
          root of the scenegraph
          and contains properties like the background color and fog. These objects define a hierarchical parent/child
          tree like structure and represent where objects appear and how they are oriented.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Mesh</b> objects represent drawing a specific Geometry with a specific Material. Both Material objects and
          Geometry objects can be used by multiple Mesh objects. For example to draw two blue cubes in different
          locations we could need
          two Mesh objects to represent the position and orientation of each cube. We would only need one Geometry to
          hold the vertex data for a cube and we would only need one Material to specify the color blue. Both Mesh
          objects could reference
          the same Geometry object and the same Material object.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Lastly, <b>light</b> objects represent different kinds of lights.</li>

      <h2>SceneGraph</h2>

      <p>
        Three.js's core is arguably its scene graph. A scene graph in a 3D engine is a hierarchy of nodes in a graph
        where each node represents a local space. You can reffer to my example of a <a href="solarSystem.html">solar
          system</a> to look
        into while reading theory
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The Earth orbits the Sun. The Moon orbits the Earth. The Moon moves in a circle around the Earth. From the
        Moon's point of view it's rotating in the "local space" of the Earth. Even though its motion relative to the Sun
        is some crazy
        spirograph like curve from the Moon's point of view it just has to concern itself with rotating around the
        Earth's local space. To think of it another way, you living on the Earth do not have to think about the Earth's
        rotation on its axis
        nor its rotation around the Sun. You just walk or drive or swim or run as though the Earth is not moving or
        rotating at all. You walk, drive, swim, run, and live in the Earth's "local space" even though relative to the
        sun you are spinning
        around the earth at around 1000 miles per hour and around the sun at around 67,000 miles per hour. Your position
        in the solar system is similar to that of the moon above but you don't have to concern yourself. You just worry
        about your
        position relative to the earth in its "local space". In the code we look at the solar system from directly above
        the origin looking down. Many a times we noticed that each time we write code in the local space of earth or
        sun, random things
        happen, for eg sun and earth's size becomes equal, earth rotates too far. We made the earthMesh a child of the
        sunMesh. The sunMesh has its scale set to 5x with >`sunMesh.scale.set(5, 5, 5)`. That means the sunMeshs local
        space is 5 times
        as big. Anything put in that space will be multiplied by 5. That means the earth is now 5x larger and its
        distance from the sun (earthMesh.position.x = 10) is also 5x as well.

        <image src="https://threejs.org/manual/resources/images/scenegraph-sun-earth.svg" />

        To fix it we add an empty scene graph node. We'll parent both the sun and the earth to that node. Our new scene
        graph will look like this.

        <image src="https://threejs.org/manual/resources/images/scenegraph-sun-earth-fixed.svg" />

        Again we added more invisible scene graph nodes. The first, an Object3D called earthOrbit and added both the
        earthMesh and the moonOrbit to it. We then added the moonMesh to the moonOrbit. The new scene graph looks like
        this.

      <h2>Mesh</h2>
      <p>
        We then create a Mesh. A Mesh in three represents the combination of a three things:-
      <ul>
        <li>
          A Geometry (the shape of the object). It's common to use primitives for things like a sphere for a globe or a
          bunch of boxes to draw a 3D graph. It's especially common to use primitives to experiment and get started with
          3D. There are various different geometries on <a href="https://threejs.org/manual/#en/primitives">three js
            docs</a>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          A Material (how to draw the object, shiny or flat, what color, what texture(s) to apply. Etc.). Three.js
          provides several types of materials. They define how objects will appear in the scene.Now there are some basic
          three js materials :-
          <ul>
            <li>
              The `MeshBasicMaterial` is not affected by lights. The `MeshLambertMaterial` computes lighting only at the
              vertices vs the `MeshPhongMaterial` which computes lighting at every pixel. The `MeshPhongMaterial` also
              supports specular highlights.
            </li>

            <p>
              The materials above use simple math to make materials that look 3D but they aren't what actually happens
              in real world. The 2 PBR materials use much more complex math to come close to what actually happens in
              the real world.
            </p>

            <li>
              The first one is `MeshStandardMaterial`. The biggest difference between `MeshPhongMaterial` and
              `MeshStandardMaterial` is it uses different parameters. `MeshPhongMaterial` had a shininess setting.
              `MeshStandardMaterial` has 2 settings roughness and metalness.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              The `MeshPhysicalMaterial` is same as the `MeshStandardMaterial` but it adds a clearcoat parameter that
              goes from 0 to 1 for how much to apply a clearcoat gloss layer and a clearCoatRoughness parameter that
              specifies how rough the gloss layer is.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          The position,orientation, and scale of that object in the scene relative to its parent.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Light</h2>
      <p>
        To study about light, please reffer to <a href="light.html">Light</a>. There I have created a plane and two
        meshes i.e. cube and sphere on 2x2 mirrored plane and used `ORbitControls` for controls menu and `lil-gui` for
        color assigning.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different lights, we start with `ambient` light. This light has no direction. This style of ambient
        lighting is actually not all that useful as lighting as it's 100% even so other than changing the color of
        everything in the scene it doesn't look much like lighting. What it does help with is making the darks not too
        dark.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>HemisphereLight</b> : A HemisphereLight takes a sky color and a ground color and just multiplies the
          material's color between those 2 colorsâ€”the sky color if the surface of the object is pointing up and the
          ground color if the surface of the object is pointing down.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <b>DirectionalLight</b> : A DirectionalLight is often used to represent the sun.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <b>Point Light</b> : A PointLight is a light that sits at a point and shoots light in all directions from that
          point.
        </li>
      </ul>
